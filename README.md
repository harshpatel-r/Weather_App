## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/harshpatel-r/Weather_App.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd Weather_App`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

---

## 📝 Local Usage
1. Create a `config/dev.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Inside the `dev.env` file, specify the necessary environment variables required for the app. For example:

```bash
FORCAST_URL=http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key={your_weatherstack_api_key}&query=
GEOCODE_URL=http://api.positionstack.com/v1/forward?access_key={your_positionstack_api_key}&query=
```
  Replace `your_weatherstack_api_key` with your actual API key for the WeatherStack API and `your_positionstack_api_key` with   your actual API key for the PositionStack API.

3. Start the application: `npm run dev`
4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## ⚠️ **Upcoming Support for Docker**

Support for running the app with Docker is currently under development. Stay tuned for updates on Docker usage instructions! We are excited to bring you the ability to run the app in a containerized environment for easier deployment and management.

## 🌐 API Integration

To retrieve weather data, this project utilizes the WeatherStack API. You will need to sign up for an API key at [https://weatherstack.com/](https://weatherstack.com/) and replace `your_weatherstack_api_key` in the `dev.env` file with your actual API key.

To retrieve location data, this project utilizes the PositionStack API. You will need to sign up for an API key at [https://positionstack.com/](https://positionstack.com/) and replace `your_positionstack_api_key` in the `dev.env` file with your actual API key.
